# Bitcoin Segwit also known as Bech32 Wallet Generator in Nodejs 
This code is a script for generating a Bitcoin address using the BIP39 and BIP32 libraries. It starts by importing the required modules such as coinkey, fs, crypto, cluster, blessed, bip39, tiny-secp256k1, bip32 and bitcoinjs-lib.

Requirements
Node.js
coinkey
fs
crypto
cluster
blessed
bip39
tiny-secp256k1
bip32
bitcoinjs-lib
Usage
Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
Run the script using node app.js.
The script will generate a seed phrase and a Bitcoin address, which will be printed to the console.
The script generates a seed phrase using the bip39 library and converts it into a seed buffer. The seed buffer is then used to generate a root node using the bip32 library. The first accountâ€™s node is derived from the root node using the path "m/44'/0'/0'". The external chain node of this account is derived using the path "0". The first address from the external chain is derived and its public key is obtained. Finally, a P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash) output script is generated using the bitcoin.payments.p2wpkh method and the Bitcoin address is printed to the console.
